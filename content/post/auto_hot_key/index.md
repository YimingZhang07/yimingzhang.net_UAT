## Hot Strings

This enables you to substitute long strings using a short code. For example if you type in `text1` and `{Enter}`, the whole literal sentences in the parathesis will be returned.

```
::text1::
(
All the sentences here,

Even the {Enter} key above will be returned exactly.
Useful when you have long repeatitive strings.
)
```
