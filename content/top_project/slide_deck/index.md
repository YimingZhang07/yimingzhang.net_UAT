## Background

This is a collection of some presentation slides I made at Communication and MSCF Presentation courses. Some background of these slides:

1.   The presentation duration were all around 3-4 minutes.
2.   All these slides are built based on the **SAME** template, and **the template is an effort of my own**, deliberately replicating the style from the street (thanks to Morgan Stanley, my first employer). I hope you don't find them tedious.
3.   The theme of the topics are usually **explaining technical terms to normal people, or advocating financial methodologies**.
