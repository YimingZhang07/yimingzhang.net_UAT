:bulb:(2022/04/20) The largest updates since the initial launch. Hope you like this. <u>More concrete content will be added. I need time to migrate and organize them well.</u>

### Who am I?

I don't think any institution or employer can help you know me, though you could view these on my LinkedIn from the left.

Instead, maybe the posts, the photos, and my thoughts on this site can better illustrate myself.

### What you can find here?
- :sunglasses: Things about me. That's why it is called `yimingzhang.net` (a digital artist has the `.com` domain, eyes on him)

- :books: Some Wikis (I call them Libraries) about Quantitative Finance, Investments and ... more to be added! I like to see my knowledge organized and searchable

- :video_game: This site can be a playground for many tough (if not crazy) ideas and experiments. I am not a CS major or a front-end developer of any kind, and this is a pure exploration. A recent idea is to add a live-streaming here so that people can watch a video synchronously with me (Why don't you just use Zoom or Skype:new_moon_with_face:)
